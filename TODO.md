# TODOs for Robot Dog RL Project

- [ ] Fix control dimension mismatch (currently 19 ctrl vs 18 joints error).
- [ ] Verify correct actuator mapping (hip, thigh, calf per leg).
- [ ] Tune PD gains (Kp, Kd) to prevent tipping over.
- [ ] Initialize robot in a more stable pose (slightly bent legs).
- [ ] Add visualization/logging of joint torques and qpos for debugging.
- [ ] Implement simple walking gait (sine wave trajectory).
- [ ] Later: extend to obstacle clearing in agricultural field simulation.
